#### Description:
This project aims to predict the outcomes of football matches using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to analyze historical match data and utilize various features to forecast whether a team will win, lose, or draw.

## Project Overview:
The project was developed as part of the CS50x course at Harvard University, focusing on applying programming skills to real-world data analysis problems. 

## Data Used:
The dataset consists of historical football match data, including features such as:
- Match date
- Teams involved
- Venue
- Goals scored (for and against)
- Shots taken
- Other relevant statistics

## Machine Learning Models:
In this project, two machine learning models were implemented:
1. **Random Forest Classifier**: A robust ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
2. **Logistic Regression**: Briefly explain the second model you choose, its purpose, and how it compares to the Random Forest.

## Model Evaluation:
The performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as:
- **Accuracy**: The ratio of correctly predicted matches to total matches.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A table used to evaluate the performance of the model by comparing actual and predicted outcomes.

## Results:
The models were trained on historical data and tested on a separate dataset. The Random Forest Classifier showed an accuracy of 61.23%, while the second model achieved an accuracy of 62.31%. 

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict sports outcomes, showcasing the potential for data analysis in the sports industry.
